# Historical boundaries of world countries

This historical boundaries project aims at providing ready-to-use base maps for mapping historical data.

All maps are stored in the geojson format: single file per feature layer, human and machine readable, easy to import in qGIS. Maps resolution is adapted for mapping data on the scale of the whole world.

Maps are in WGS 84 projection EPSG:4326. For now, a 2km shift in most places.   

All contributions and amendments are absolutely welcome. When correcting, please make sure that boundaries in each file remain aligned. 

When using the data, keep in mind that 

1. historical boundaries are even more disputed than contemporary ones, and that 
2. the actual concept of national boundary becomes meaningful, in Europe, only since the [Peace of Westphalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia) (1648).

## Credits:
This project is a collection of basemaps collected, adpated and converted from diverse sources, sometimes only available through the wayback machine. Among these, anonymous students from the "ThinkQuest Team C006628".
